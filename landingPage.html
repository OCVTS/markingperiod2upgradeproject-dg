<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>Dice game created using languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are a total of 4 dice that are rolled and display the number 
    rolled for each dice. This is activated when you click on the roll dice button. After the player and computer rolls, the code will add up the 
    total number and determine a winner out of the two, "Player Wins!" or "Computer Wins!".</p>

    <h2>Process Challenges</h2>
<p>Functions such as, rollDice, playerScore, and calculate are all used to ensure that my dice game is working properly.
    I styled my dice game using elements such as background-color, font-family, and text-align. Some challenges I faced 
    while working on my project was aligning images directly under the player and computer names and getting the roll button to actually roll the dice. 
    The hardest, most challenging being changing the images of the dice based on what you rolled. I overcame this issue by using "if... else if...""
     statements and "document.querySelector()". </p>
